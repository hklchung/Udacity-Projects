Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Projects
The following projects are aimed at developing practical experience on the implementation of machine learning algorithms. We begin with a dataset, a procedure of pre-processing is carried out to clean and validate the data, followed by splitting the data into training and testing sets. From here on, we combine techniques such as grid search and use of scoring metrics to determine the best performing model for our data as well as tuning certain parameters specific to each model. All projects were done in Python 2.7 with Scikit-Learn 0.17. The projects are as follow:
1) Boston Housing Price Prediction - Advanced Regression Models
2) Titanic Survival Prediciton - Decision Trees and Random Forest
3) Finding Donors - Support Vector Machines
4) Image Processing (Eigenfaces) - Principal Component Analysis
5) Customer Segments - Principal Component Analysis and K-Means Clustering
